# Online-Library-Management
The Online Library Management is a web-based application developed in order to digitize traditional libraries, which face various problems related to record-keeping. On this website, a teacher/student can register/login and create/access their respective accounts in order to view, issue and return books. The admin and various librarians can grant books, along with adding and updating the stock of books and viewing various transactions in the form of online tables which ease the process of record-keeping. The Admin also acts as a supervisor with respect to librarians and can add/remove them as well.

The tech stack used to build this website includes:-
1. HTML
